## Deploy to render.com

To deploy to [render.com](https://dashboard.render.com/) do the following:

1. Create a Postgres database. After preparing it, copy *Internal Database URL*.
2. Create Web Service, select your fork.
3. Name — it is better to use a prefix with your nickname. For example *fey-runit*.
4. Region — any, you can use *Frankfurt (EU Central)* but make sure that Web Service and database are using the same region.
5. Branch — from which the application will be deployed. You can use `main` for starters. In the future, use the branch in which you want to demonstrate the changes.
6. Root Directory — leave blank.
7. Runtime — *Node*.
8. Build Command — `make install build`.
9. Start Command — `make db-migrate start-prod`.
10. You can choose any plan, free is enough.
11. Set environment variables. Click on *Advanced* and *Add Environment Variable*.

The following variables will be needed:

* `DATABASE_URL` — this is the URL you copied earlier — *Internal Database URL*
* `NODE_ENV` — `production`
* `SECRET_KEY_JWT` — any string, you can generate a random string or insert `simpleDevKey` for simplicity
* `TRANSPORT_MAILER_URL` — this should be the URL of the connection string of the mail sender. You can use the [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) service for tests. An example url would be `smtp://login:password@sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io:2525`.

Click on *Create Web Service* and watch the Deployment and Logs. If there are problems, ask questions [here](https://github.com/hexlet-rus/runit/discussions/categories/q-a). Check first that there is no similar open topic.

### Configuring authorization via GitHub

To set up authorization with OAuth 2.0, you need to [create and configure a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps).

In your GitHub App settings, specify `{appURL}/api/oauth` for *Authorization callback URL*, where *{appURL}* is the web address of your deploy.

Define the following environment variables for the deploy:

* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` *Client ID* from your GitHub App.
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` Generate a new *Client secret* in the GitHub App settings and specify it here.
* `OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL=https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
* `OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`
* `GITHUB_USER_URL=https://api.github.com/user`

*Note. You may decide to use [OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps) instead of GitHub App. GitHub does not recommend this type of app, but it could be easier to set up for testing purposes.*
